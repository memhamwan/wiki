# Contributing to the Wiki

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the wiki, whether it's something as simple as fixing a typo or as complex as creating a new article. If you don't already have access to the repository, stop by our [#netops-chat](https://discord.gg/uYtTVjpBGn) channel and ask for access. Then, you're free to contribute! The beautiful thing about a wiki is, you can contribute at your own pace.

# Using the web editor

GitLab has a basic web editor for managing wiki pages; simply push the edit button once you have access.

# Doing local development

If you're not a ruby developer, and you're on a mac, you probably want to take a look at [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#readme) in order for these tools to work properly.

```
gem install gollum

# Special instructions to build the sidebar

The sidebar used on this wiki is a custom sidebar, but it is generated by code using `python3 create_table_of_contents.py > _sidebar`. If you add a new file, please ensure that you run this to get the page added. Or, ask a netop for help.
