MemHamWAN has two places to see information on the status of the network.

[Statuspage](https://memhamwan.statuspage.io/) is used to provide a big-picture view of our network, hosted services, and select sponsored services. Information here generally is inputted by a person, so there can be a bit of a delay. But this is where we communicate upcoming maintenance, outages, and updates on activities to maintain service. You can “Subscribe to Updates” in order to get e-mailed as network issues occur.

[Alertmanager](https://alertmanager.memhamwan.net) is our on-network tool for triggering alerts when troublesome metrics are found. Note that these alerts don’t always represent an outage, but instead they may indicate impending issues that need to be acted on to avoid an outage. This is what our netops monitor, and it is the system that sends us notification in the #netops channel in Slack.
