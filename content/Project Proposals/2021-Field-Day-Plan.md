This document represents the plan for MemHamWAN's participation in the 2021 joint field day between MARA, Delta Club, Neshoba, Tri State Repeater, and MemHamWAN. This year, the chosen location is [Germantown Municipal Park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=35.0976097&mlon=-89.8036491&zoom=17).

# Background

- [What is field day](http://www.arrl.org/field-day)?
- MemHamWAN has participated in the local joint field day for every year since it began
- Field day is our de-facto tent pole marketing event for the year (both with clubs and with the general public); we need to treat it as such an opportunity

# Our Goals

- Raise awareness to the community of the MemHamWAN project
  - Measurement: hand out 20 flyers during the course of the event
- Demonstrate HamWAN's capabilities
  - Measurement: host a wireless network for use by the field day contest stations
  - Measurement: connect to HamWAN using only portable equipment
- Engage interested community members in a data and "IoT" oriented arm of amateur radio not seen in other areas
  - Measurement: demonstrate on-network services to 10 people
  - Measurement: have 2 people join the Slack organization
