Every calendar year, a filing with the Divison of Business Services from the Department of State of Tennessee must be filed. Otherwise, a certificate of administrative dissolution is received. These are the instructions for how to submit this annual filing.

1. Navigate to [their website](https://tnbear.tn.gov/Ecommerce/AnnualReportID.aspx)
2. Enter the control number; in 2021 it was 762526
3. Follow the instructions on the website; officers are simply president and secretary, and the board of directors is the board
4. When at the payment portion, choose whichever is cheapest; in 2021, that was eCheck; this is also most convenient as it avoids requiring reimbursements. Refer to the password manager for the bank account information.
